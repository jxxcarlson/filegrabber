# FileGrabber

__FileGrabber__  uses pure Elm to grab a list of files from  a list of URLs, transform the received data into `Bytes` values, create a tar archive for the files, and download the  archive to disk using `File.Download`.

Just run the app and you will see what it does.  It illustrates some of the capabilities of `elm/bytes` and `elm/file`.
